GridPY
======

GridPy is a python module for mapping coordinates into squares and rectangles.
A major feature is the ability to use diagonal coordinates on square grids

Purpose
-------
This module is for those who need to index over a grid. Often such sequencing is
useful for games involving a square grid such as chess or connect-four.

Use
---
Flat coordinates are array indices.
They can be converted to matrix and diagonal coordinates.

Future updates
--------------
Future updates to this module may include flips and rotations for matrix coordinates,
and diagonal coordinates for rectangles.
